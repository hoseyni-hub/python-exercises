# Coding Practice Repository

This repository contains my step-by-step coding exercises while learning Python.  
The purpose of this repo is to track my progress, improve problem-solving skills, and build consistency.  

- Organized by **weeks** and **days** (e.g., Week 6 - Day 1).  
- Includes small exercises, algorithms, and beginner-friendly projects.  
- Shows my learning journey before moving on to real-world projects.  

Later, I will also add more advanced projects (web apps, scripts, and tools) in separate repositories.  
This repository is mainly for practice and documenting my growth.
